# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, floors, city, and other structural and locational attributes. The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and analyzed before training multiple regression models to improve prediction accuracy.

## 📌 Project Overview

House prices vary significantly due to multiple factors, including location, size, and structural features. The goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices using historical housing data.

## 🔍 Key Features

✅ **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering (e.g., price per sqft).  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing relationships between features and house prices using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.  
✅ **Feature Engineering:** One-hot encoding cities, normalizing numerical data, and applying log transformations where necessary.  
✅ **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
- **Linear Regression**  
- **Random Forest Regressor**  
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**  
- **Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance**  
✅ **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score to measure model effectiveness.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains various housing features such as:
- **Numerical features:** Square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, floors, year built, etc.
- **Categorical features:** City, condition, waterfront presence, etc.
- **Target variable:** House price

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning Models)  

## ⚡ Results & Insights

After training different models, the best-performing model achieved:

- **MAE:** 22,291.79  
- **MSE:** 1,495,480,709.71  
- **RMSE:** 38,671.45  
- **R² Score:** 0.5711  

The results show that incorporating **feature engineering** (e.g., log transformation, price per sqft) and **model selection** significantly improves predictive accuracy.

## 📌 Future Improvements

🚀 **Feature selection & engineering:** Further refine influential variables  
🚀 **Hyperparameter tuning:** Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for better model optimization  
🚀 **Deep Learning Approach:** Experiment with neural networks for potential performance gains
